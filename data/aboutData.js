		`Hello! I'm Behnam Dakermanji, a passionate web developer with a unique journey. Originally from Syria, I migrated to Canada in 2019 due to the war. While I was a medical doctor in Syria, my true passion has always been programming. I began my coding journey with online courses on platforms like Udemy and edX, and have since earned three diplomas in web programming from Concordia University.`,
		`My professional experience includes working as an IT consultant for a driving school in Montreal and currently as a game tester with Keywords Studios. In the evenings, I channel my creativity and skills into freelancing projects. I love solving complex problems and creating seamless user experiences. Let's build something amazing together!`,
